# Japan's Agricultural Symphony: A Data-Driven Exploration ðŸŒ¾

## Overview ðŸ“‹

This project dives deep into the intricate relationship between Japan's rich cultural traditions and its agricultural sector. Utilizing a dataset managed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF), we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the subject matter.

### Key Features âœ¨

- **Data Integrity**: Advanced data preparation and imputation techniques to ensure robust analysis.
- **Forecasting**: Utilization of Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Random Forest models for future agricultural yield predictions.
- **Transparency**: Implementation of Explainable AI (XAI) methods like SHAP, SHAPley, and LIME for model interpretability.
- **Policy Insights**: Data-driven discussions to aid policy-making and agricultural strategies.

## Introduction ðŸŒ±

Japan's rich cultural heritage is intricately woven into its agricultural fabric. This project aims to explore this relationship in depth, backed by data and predictive modeling. Our journey is led by a dataset curated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF), offering a comprehensive look at crop yields across different timelines.

## Dataset ðŸ“Š

The dataset used in this project shows weekly vegetable prices in yen per kilogram. It covers various vegetables like Cabbage, Green Onion, Lettuce, Potato, Onion, and many more. The dataset contains several missing values and is not formatted properly.

### Data Pre-processing ðŸ§¹

The data is cleaned and prepared for analysis. Missing values are addressed using mean and median imputation, LOCF (Last Observation Carried Forward), and NOCB (Next Observation Carried Backward) methods. [More details here]

### Forecasting ðŸ“ˆ

This section focuses on forecasting future agricultural outputs using Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Random Forest algorithms. [More details here]
